# sampleBarCodeScan
This sample contain RSBarCode as the Source classes. I have added these classes to make it dependency free in swift.

Download RSBarCode Project from https://github.com/yeahdongcn/RSBarcodes_Swift.
Add all the classes from 'Source' Folder to the project(avoid info.plist).
Make sure you tick on 'copy items if needed'.
On View Controller: import AVFoundation and import RSBarcodes.
